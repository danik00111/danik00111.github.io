- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @danik00111
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding, speedcubing, reading, gaming, and Discord, and it's a mystery how do i still have a life and find time to touch grass.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JSX and will soon move on to TS
- ðŸ“« It's easy to find me - `@deepfrieduser` on Discord
