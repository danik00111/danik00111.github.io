- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @danik00111
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding, speedcubing, reading, gaming, and Discord, and it's a mystery how do i still have a life and find time to touch grass.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning FrontEnd JS in a group
- ğŸ“« It's easy to find me - `@deepfrieduser` on Discord

Here are all of my repositories:
- [banderogus](./banderogus)
This is just a test to see if this works, i don't have just one public repo.
